## Proposed Project

My project will be simulating the Monty Hall Paradox. The application will
have a console interface. It will simulate 500,000 times. It will return
the probability of staying vs. the probability of switching.

## Outline Structure

Top-Level Supervisor manages the state and a second supervisor. The second supervisor
manages the GenServers that generate the simulations. If time permits, I will
implement a Phoenix framework to interface with the application.
